PennyLane
==========

[PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/) is a cross-platform Python library for [quantum computing](https://pennylane.ai/qml/quantum-computing/), [quantum machine learning](https://pennylane.ai/qml/quantum-machine-learning/), and [quantum chemistry](https://pennylane.ai/qml/quantum-chemistry/). Train a quantum computer the same way as a neural network.

# Installation Instructions

There are a number of ways to deploy PennyLane. You may use a package manager such as `python pip` or `conda` or Docker container:
* PyPI is the official repository for PennyLane and Lightningâ€™s compiled binaries, and installation through pip is recommended when it is
available.
* Conda-Forge is an organization maintaining a large database of conda recipes. A so-called feedstock exists for each Lightning plugin, which
enables installing PennyLane and Lightning in Conda environments.
* Should there be one reason or another PyPI and Conda are not reliable options, it is possible to use Lightning in a Docker container. The PennyLaneAI
DockerHub account hosts a number of different images of the various Lightning plugins.

PennyLane requires Python version 3.10 and above. Installation of PennyLane, as well as all dependencies, will be done using `pip`.

## Install PyPI and JupyterLab

[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) provides powerful tools for scientific investigations due to their interactive and flexible nature. Jupyter Notebooks provide a versatile and powerful environment for conducting scientific investigations, facilitating both the analysis and the clear communication of results.

1. Install all the prerequisites and dependencies
   * DNF / YUM
     ```bash
     # RHEL, Rocky, Alma, CentOS Stream
     sudo dnf install python python-pip
     ```
   * APT
     ```bash
     # Ubuntu
     sudo apt install python python-pip
     ```
   * Pacman
     ```bash
     # Arch
     sudo dnf install python python-pip
     ```
1. Create and Activate a New Virtual Environment

   Separate your python projects and ensure that they exist in their own, clean environments:
   ```bash
   python -m venv pennylane
   source pennylane/bin/activate
   ```
1. Install Project Jupyter and Plotly plotting utilities and dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install jupyterlab ipywidgets plotly jupyter-dash
   pip install aiohttp fsspec h5py
   ```
1. Start the JupyterLab server
   ```bash
   jupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8889 --no-browser
   ```
   * `--ip` binds to all interfaces on your head node, including the public facing address
   * `--port` bind to the port that you granted access to in `nftables`
   * --no-browser, do not try to launch a browser directly on your head node.
1. Carefully copy your `<TOKEN>` from the command line after successfully launching your JupyterLab server.
   ```bash
   # Look for a line similar to the one below, and carefully copy your <TOKEN>
   http://127.0.0.1:8889/lab?token=<TOKEN>
   ```
1. Open a browser on you workstation and navigate to your JupyterLab server on your headnode:
   ```bash
   http://<headnode_public_ip>:8889
   ```
1. Login to your JupyterLab server using your `<TOKEN>`.

> [!TIP]
> Should you have issues exposing you public facing interface to your Jupyter Lab server, remember that you can use a local SSH forwarding tunnel, between your local machine and your remote server:
>
> `ssh -N -L 8889:localhost:8889 <USER>@<HEADNODE_IP> -i ~/.ssh/<PATH_TO_SSH_KEY>`

# PennyLane Lightning-Qubit

You can install / upgrade PennyLane and `lightning.qubit` with either of the following command. All the core dependencies will be satisfied and resolved implicitly.

```bash
pip install pennylane --upgrade

# or you can explicitly install lightning, which will also pull pennylane dependencies.
# pip install penylane-lightning
```
The Lightning plugin ecosystem provides fast state-vector and tensor network simulators written in C++ `lightning.qubit` device uses a custom-built backend to perform fast linear algebra calculations for simulating quantum state-vector evolution, you can find more details about it at [Lightning Documentation](https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/lightning/en/stable/index.html).

# Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)

In this benchmark you will be reproducing the results from the recent paper published by some of Xanadu's authors [Hybrid quantum programming with PennyLane Lightning on HPC platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02512).

The [Variational Quantum Eigensolver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtepXvx5zdI) (VQE) is one of the flagship algorithms for quantum chemistry which utilizes the [Rayleigh-Ritz Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Ritz_method) where near-term quantum computers are trained to determine the ground-state of a given molecule.

You do not need to worry about the details of the implementation, but the VQE Algorithm takes (i) a molecular Hamiltonian and a parametrized circuit preparing the quantum state of the molecule as inputs. The **Cost Function** is then defined as the expectation value of the Hamiltonian in the initial trial state. Performing an iterative minimization of this cost function is the how we obtained the desired ground state, using a classical optimizer which leverages a quantum computer to calculate the gradient of the cost function at each optimization step.

The following Python script `lightning_qubit.py` calculates the total ground state energy of a water molecule.

```python
import pennylane as qml
from pennylane import numpy as np

mol = qml.data.load("qchem", molname="H2O", bondlength=0.958, basis="STO-3G")[0]
hf_state, ham = mol.hf_state, mol.hamiltonian
wires = ham.wires
dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=wires, batch_obs=True)

n_electrons = mol.molecule.n_electrons
singles, doubles = qml.qchem.excitations(n_electrons, len(wires))

# Create the QNode
@qml.qnode(dev, diff_method="adjoint")
def cost(weights):
    qml.AllSinglesDoubles(weights, wires, hf_state, singles, doubles)
    return qml.expval(ham)

params = qml.numpy.array(np.random.normal(0, np.pi, len(singles) + len(doubles)))
opt = qml.AdagradOptimizer(stepsize=0.2)
max_iterations = 1000
energies = [np.nan]
conv_tolerance = 1e-7

# Loop until converged, or the max iterations are hit
for n in range(max_iterations):
    params, prev_energy = opt.step_and_cost(cost, params)
    energies.append(prev_energy)
    if not n % 10: # print every 10 steps
        print(f"Step={n}, energy={prev_energy}")
    if np.abs(energies[-1] - energies[-2]) < conv_tolerance:
        break

print(f"Energy={cost(params)}")
```

## Single Thread Workload [2%]

Run the benchmark using ***either*** of the following methods:
1. Pass the Python script to the `python` command in your `venv` environment
   ```bash
   # Trying to use you system's Python binary, instead of the one in your local Python Virtual Environment may result in missing library errors.

   python lightning_qubit.py
   ```
1. Make the Python script executable from directly within the Command Shell:
   * Prepend the appropriate Bash Shebang to the beginning of the script, to indicate which interpreter to use:
     ```python
     #!/<PATH-TO-YOUR-VENV-DIR>/bin/python
     ```
   * Use `chmod` to add the executable flag to the script:
     ```bash
     chmod +x lightning_qubit.py
     ```
   * Run the executable Python script:
     ```bash
     ./lightning_qubit.py
     ```

You are required to redirect and save the output to a file and should see the following output:
```bash
qchem/H2O/STO-3G/0.958/H2O_STO-3G_0.958.h5 117.38/117.38 MB
Step=0, energy=-49.25521883614754
Step=10, energy=-71.6135397945159
Step=20, energy=-73.89606868879673

...

Step=900, energy=-74.9736932457384
Step=910, energy=-74.97372216409832
Step=920, energy=-74.97374818042671
Energy=-74.97375639361245
```

Verify the number of cores that this benchmark ran on with a screenshot from either 'Grafana' or your *preferred* implementation of `top`.

## Multi-Threaded Workload Using Kokkos [8%]

For the next part of the benchmark, you'll be required to rebuild [PennyLane Lightning](https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/lightning/en/stable/lightning_kokkos/installation.html) using [Kokkos](https://kokkos.org/kokkos-core-wiki/index.html), the C++ Performance Portability Programming Ecosystem. Kokkos exploits the inherent parallelism of modern processing units, in this case those specifically supporting the [OpenMP Threads](https://www.openmp.org/) programming model.

> [!TIP]
> You are ***strongly*** advised to make use of modules, or at the very least locally deploy your cluster software onto a directory accessible to all of your nodes over `NFS`, i.e. `<PATH_TO_SOFTWARE_DIR>`.

You can build PennyLane Lightning's Kokkos variant from source.
1. Install the required system build toolchains:
   * DNF / YUM
     ```bash
     cmake make gcc etc...
     ```
   * APT
   * Pacman
     ```bash
     sudo pacman -S base-devel gcc-fortran
     sudo pacman -S openmp
     ```
1. Download, Build and Configure Kokkos:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos
   cd kokkos

   # You will need to ensure that <PATH_TO_SOFTWARE_DIR> exists if you want to make use of the prefix variable:
   cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebugInfo \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<PATH_TO_SOFTWARE_DIR> \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=20 \
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON \
    -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=OFF \
    -DKokkos_ENABLE_SERIAL:BOOL=ON \
    -DKokkos_ENABLE_EXAMPLES:BOOL=OFF \
    -DKokkos_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=OFF \
    -DKokkos_ENABLE_LIBDL:BOOL=OFF
   ```
1. Make and install Kokkos into `<PATH_TO_SOFTWARE_DIR>`:
   ```bash
   cmake --build build && cmake --install build
   ```
1. Append the install location to the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` variable:
   ```bash
   export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<PATH_TO_SOFTWARE_DIR>:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
   ```
1. Download PennyLane from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning
   cd pennylane-lightning

   # This benchmark has been tested against Release 0.038, you may experience problems with the latest build, there try
   git checkout v0.38.0_release
   ```

> [!TIP]
> If you're struggling to find your C/C++ Compiler(s), you can either set the following environment variable(s) by prepending the `cmake` command:
>
> `CC=$(which gcc) CXX=$(which g++)`
>
> Alternatively these can be passed as options into `cmake`:
>
> `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=$(which gcc) -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$(which g++)`.
>
> Remember that there are many versions available of `gcc`, `icc`, or even `mpicc`, and that instead of `which` you may want to use a specific version, i.e. `lmod`...

### PennyLane-Lightning.Kokkos[Serial]

You will now build, compile and install the serial device backend for PennyLane-Lightning.Kokkos:
```bash
PL_BACKEND="lightning_kokkos" python scripts/configure_pyproject_toml.py
CMAKE_ARGS="-DKokkos_ENABLE_SERIAL=ON" PL_BACKEND="lightning_kokkos" pip install -e . --config-settings editable_mode=compat --force --no-cache-dir --verbose
```

Copy your `lightning_qubit.py` script to `lightning_kokkos_serial.py` and make use of the `time` module to measure your scripts execution time:
* Edit the top of the file and record the start time *(this will optionally go below your Shabang if you make your Python script executable)*:
  ```python
  #!/<PATH-TO-YOUR-VENV-DIR>/bin/python
  import time
  start_time = time.time()
  ```
* Replace the serial `lightning.qubit` device backend with the serial one `lighting_kokkos`:
  ```python
  dev = qml.device("lightning.kokkos", wires=wires, batch_obs=True)
  ```
* Record the execution time at the very end of the file
  ```python
  end_time = time.time()
  run_time = end_time - start_time
  print(f"Execution time: {run_time}")
  ```

Rerun the benchmark. You must once again redirect the output and take note of the number of CPU cores being utilized during the run.

### PennyLane-Lightning.Kokkos[OpenMP]

You will now build, compile and install the OpenMP device backend for PennyLane-Lightning.Kokkos:

1. Install the required system `openmp` threads package and build toolchains (i.e. `cmake`, `make`, `gcc`, etc...):
1. Rebuild and Reconfigure Kokkos:
   * Enable the `OPENMP` build option for `cmake`:
     ```bash
     -DKokkos_ENABLE_OPENMP:BOOL=ON
     ```
   * If you're not making use of `lmod`, it may be beneficial to you to make use of an alternative install path for `<PATH_TO_KOKKOS[OPENMP]>`:
     ```bash
     -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<PATH_TO_KOKKOS[OPENMP]>
     ```
1. Rebuild and Reconfigure PennyLane-Lightning.Kokkos:
   * Ensure that you enable the `OPENMP` arguments for `cmake`
   ```bash
   PL_BACKEND="lightning_kokkos" python scripts/configure_pyproject_toml.py
   CMAKE_ARGS="-DKokkos_ENABLE_OPENMP=ON" PL_BACKEND="lightning_kokkos" pip install -e . --config-settings editable_mode=compat --force --no-cache-dir --verbose
   ```
1. Copy `lightning_kokkos_serial.py` to `lightning_kokkos_openmp.py` and edit the script to configure and set the `ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE` for the number of OpenMP threads.
   * At the top of the file, after you've recorded the `start_time`:
     ```python
     start_time = time.time()
     import os
     os.environ["OMP_NUM_THREADS"] = "<NUM_THREADS>"
     ```

> [!TIP]
> Typically the environment variable is configured as a shell export. Depending on the implementation of your compiler, you may need to also set similar variable for `"MKL_NUM_THREADS"` and similarly, if you'd like squeeze out additional performance consider configuring `numpy` with OpenMP support and setting again a similar variable for `"NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS"`.
> You may try to make use of the following *Kernel Performance Tuning* parameters for an improved result:
>
> **Build Options**
>
> `-DLQ_ENABLE_KERNEL_OMP=ON -DLQ_ENABLE_KERNEL_AVX_STREAMING=ON"`
>
> **Environment settings**
>
> `os.environ["OMP_PROC_BIND"] = "spread"`
> `os.environ["OMP_PLACES"] = "threads"`

Increase the maximum number of iterations until you've achieved convergence. You may **NOT** reduce the tolerance. Submit your script files, all output files and report your best `run_time`, lower is better.
